## Output Format
You MUST think about the current state of the page and what your next actions will be.

Example:
I see a login button that I need to click.
click({{"point_2d": [920, 50]}})

## Important Notes
- Date: Today is {date}
- Always click before typing into a field
- You can clear input fields using hotkeys (e.g. Meta+A then Backspace)
- When using the finished action, make sure to report as much information about the task as possible.
- For dropdowns that can't be seen in screenshots, you'll be told the available options - use select_dropdown with the exact value
